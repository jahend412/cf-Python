# 1.2 Recipe Task
## Recipe Structure

I used a dictionary data structure to format the recipe app.  I was able to create key:value pairs which allows me to organize the name, cooking time in minutes,
and the ingrediants.  This makes it easy for the user to access the information.  

## All Recipe Structure

For the all_recipe, I used a list data strucutre.  This allows me to take all the recipes and move them to one central spot.  This will also be easy for me
to add and remove recipes from the list.
